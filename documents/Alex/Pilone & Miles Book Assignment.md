# Pilone & Miles Book Assignment

## By: Alex Richardson

### Problem 1

The two major concerns for any software project are: how much will it cost? and how long will it take? I think project length is a bigger concern because duration directly effects the cost. "Time is money" or, more specifically, cost is largely a product of time. Complete functionality implies that your software project also pleases the customer because if your employer doesn't like it then it's wrong. You must be in a consistent loop with the person hiring you.

### Problem 2

The Agile method is making small incremental changes that eventually build into the larger product and its four main phases are requirements, design, code, and test.

### Problem 3

The Waterfall method is calculating estimated time and importance. You generally do these calculations in iterations of about 20 working days. If the customer wants to add new important features to the already long pipeline of tasks, the iteration design allows for you to squeeze those tasks in the near future. Be careful of your deadline as new features are added.

### Problem 4

User story is taking the customers intial needs and reworking them as individual requirements written in the customer's language.

Blueskying is thinking BIG early on in brainstorming and not ruling ANYTHING out

Four things that user stories SHOULD do:

 1. describe one thing that the software needs to do for the customer
 2. be written using language that the customer understands
 3. be written by the customer
 4. be short

Three things that user stories SHOULD NOT do:

  1. be a long essay
  2. use technical terms unfamiliar to the customer
  3. mention specific technologies

### Problem 5

> All assumptions are bad, and no assumption is a good assumption.

Yes, all assumptions are bad because that often indicates misunderstanding amongst the development team. To eliminate assumptions you talk through each issue and collect input from the entire team before making time estimates. If the estimates vary greatly, then there are more assumptions that need to be rooted out.

> A big user story estimate is a bad user story estimate.

Yes, with 20 day iterations, anything longer is much more likely to be an inaccurate estimate. To fix that issue, break them into smaller stories and talk to your customer again.

### Problem 6

- You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: User Story
- The more of me there are, the clearer things become: User Story
- I help you capture EVERYTHING: Blueskying
- I help you get more from the customer: Role Playing
- In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: Observation
- Some people say I'm arrogant, but really I'm just about confidence: Estimate
- Everyone's involved when it comes to me: Blueskying

### Problem 7

A "better than best case" estimate happens when asking an employee how long a project will take. They tend to assume they are working alone, they will make no mistakes, and that testing is someone else's job

### Problem 8

If your estimates don't match your customer's timeline, you should discuss it right away and decide necessary features for version 1.0. Your customer will not be happy but it is better to have this conversation earlier than later. You should add an iteration, explain that overflow work will happen later, and be transparent with the calculations behind your estimates

### Problem 9

Branching allows for code modifications to be made in parrallel. The master branch, or trunk, is the original branch. Branching helps especially in large projects because many roles need to be filled, including developers, build managers, and quality assurance.

### Problem 10

I have not used a build tool before. Build tools automate the mundane tasks of coding, such as downloading dependencies and packaging code into binary executables. Build tools are more valuable for larger developments are help with organizing large environments.
