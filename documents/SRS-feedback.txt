"yung gan" Project SRS Feedback
===============================

Damn, you guys.... this is very very good.

There are a few things that need some re-work, and they all revolve around
splitting requirements statements up.

First, you did a great job with the CSCI breakdown section.  You specifically
denote the parts.  The problem is, your requirements section is "monolithic"
and doesn't give the reader any idea of details for how the requirements are
related to the CSCI components.

Second, be careful when crafting requirements so that you don't include too
much in a single requirement.

Here is an example of what I mean:
YOURS:
5.3   Functional Requirements by CSC
<< your introduction paragraph to this section is great, BTW >>
5.3.1 The generator application shall include a required input parameter for
       number of songs to generate
5.3.2 The generator application shall include a required input parameter for
       the export file path location.
5.3.3 The generator application shall include an option for sub-genre.
5.3.4 The generator application shall include an option for genre.
5.3.5 The generator application shall include an option for giving a filepath
       to a saved generator in h5 format.

RE-WORKED:
5.3   Functional Requirements by CSC
<< your introduction paragraph to this section is great, BTW >>
5.3.1    Server CSC
5.3.1.1  Generator CSU
5.3.1.1.1   The Generator CSU shall include a required input parameter for
            user entry of the number of songs to generate
5.3.1.1.2   The Generator CSU shall include a required input parameter for
            user entry of an export file path location.
5.3.1.1.3   The Generator CSU shall include an option for selecting genre.
5.3.1.1.4   The Generator CSU shall include an option for selecting sub-genre.
5.3.1.1.5   The Generator CSU shall include an option for giving a filepath
            to a saved generator.
            The filepath will be specified in h5 format.

Note that the "will" statement under 5.3.1.1.5 HAS NO NUMBER and is associated
with the "shall" statement above it.  It explains the format used, which is
more of a "how" not a "what".  SRS statements should focus on "what".

Initial submission 7% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      9% out of 10% = 90% which is an A-minus
